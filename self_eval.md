# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
## Feel pretty confident with the built in methods. Been keep a list of methods that frequently come up or seem necessary to use.  
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
## Definitely feeling better after our group session going over it and completing the methods assignment and CFU.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
## When do we know we need to define a method rather than try to use a built in method?  I'm not sure I understand the second part of the question but methods are capable being reused as many time as needed once they have been defined.  .
